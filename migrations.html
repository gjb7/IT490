<p>Database migrations provide a way to make changes to the database without having to write the SQL yourself. This is helpful for when you need to support multiple database systems, as well as providing a reliable and consistent way of creating and setting up your database. This document will outline how you can create new migrations as well as execute any new migrations.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In certain places, you will be asked to run a command with PHP. If you're using NJIT's AFS, the default version of PHP installed does not support MySQL connections. You must instead use <code>/usr/local/bin/php</code>.</p>

<a name="creating-a-migration" class="anchor" href="#creating-a-migration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating a Migration</h2>

<p>Creating a new database migration is fairly simple. Open a new command line window, and navigate to the root of the project. Execute the following command: <code>php -f migrate.php new &lt;migration name&gt;</code>. This will create a new migration in <code>app/migration/</code> with the name you provided.</p>

<p>To actually write the migration code, open up the file that you just created. At the top of the file, after the first <code>use</code> statement, add the following line:</p>

<pre><code>use Illuminate\Database\Capsule\Manager as Capsule;</code></pre>

<p>From there you can follow Laravel's <a href="http://four.laravel.com/docs/schema">Schema documentation</a> for creating with one modification: you must use <code>Capsule::schema()</code> in place of <code>Schema</code> in Laravel's documentation. Other than that, follow Laravel's guide.</p>

<p>Once you've created your migration, you need to then tell your database about the changes. All you need to do is go back into your project root directory in a command line window, and execute the following command: <code>php -f migrate.php</code>. This will find any new migrations that need to be run against the database, and runs them. After this command executes, you're free to start using the new database changes.</p>
